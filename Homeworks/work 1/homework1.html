            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Elena Gheorghiu</strong>, I am an ambitious person,
                at the beginning of a new chapter in my life,
                seeking to transition from a career in retail to one in IT.
                Over the past year, I have dedicated myself to learning programming through various IT courses,
                determined to build a career in this dynamic field.
                I love nature and find inspiration and relaxation both by the sea and in the mountains.
                In my free time, I enjoy reading and expanding my knowledge by listening to podcasts,
                especially those about investments and other diverse topics.
                I'm committed to using my new skills to create a better future in the IT industry.
                I'm also fascinated by AI and robots,AI involves programming machines to think, learn, and make decisions like humans, while robotics focuses on creating machines that can perform tasks autonomously.
                When combined, AI and robotics result in intelligent robots capable of learning from their environment and improving over time.
                These technologies are being applied in areas like autonomous vehicles, industrial automation, and healthcare.
                Their potential to revolutionize industries is immense, but they also raise ethical and societal questions, such as impacts on jobs and privacy, making their responsible development crucial.
